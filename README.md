API.AI Webhook for Tasks
======================

A simple webhook for [api.ai](https://api.ai/) that uses [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/), in Java. Dependencies are handled with gradle.

It provides basic support for showing and creating tasks.

Tested with the api.ai project included in the repository (`TaskManager.zip`), by using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for having a public HTTPS address.
